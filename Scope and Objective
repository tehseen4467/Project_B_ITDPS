1) Background

Organizations face increasing insider threats, including data theft, sabotage, and unintentional data loss, driven by cloud adoption, remote work, and complex access environments. Because insiders operate with legitimate credentials, distinguishing malicious behavior from normal activity remains difficult.
Traditional security tools such as SIEM, UBA, and DLP rely heavily on static rules and reactive detection. This results in high false-positive rates and analyst alert fatigue. Recent research shows that machine learning and behavioral analytics can more effectively model normal user behavior and detect anomalies. However, challenges remain around scalability, explainability, and data governance.
This project proposes an Insider Threat Detection and Prevention System (ITDPS) that leverages behavioral analytics and hybrid machine learning techniques to improve real-time threat detection while maintaining transparency, privacy, and ethical compliance.

-> Objectives

1) Design a hybrid machine learning detection system using supervised and unsupervised learning to identify insider threat behaviors.
2) Apply Explainable AI (XAI) techniques such as SHAP and LIME to improve model transparency and reduce false positives.
3) Ensure compliance with privacy and legal requirements through data anonymization and governance controls aligned with regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA.
4) Develop an interactive visualization dashboard to support security analysts in monitoring alerts and user behavior patterns in real time.

-> Project Outcome

The expected outcome is a scalable and explainable insider threat detection framework that improves detection accuracy, reduces alert fatigue, and supports ethical and privacy-aware security operations.
